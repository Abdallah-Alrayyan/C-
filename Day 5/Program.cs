//1. * *What is a Constructor ? **
//   A constructor is a special method in a class that is automatically called when an object of the class is created.It is used to initialize the object’s properties and ensure the object is in a valid state.

//---

//2. **What are the Basic Concepts of OOPs?**  
//   - **Encapsulation**: Wrapping data(fields) and behavior(methods) into a single unit (class) and restricting access using access modifiers.  
//   - **Abstraction * *: Hiding implementation details and exposing only the necessary features.  
//   - **Inheritance**: Allowing a class to inherit properties and methods from another class to promote code reuse.  
//   - **Polymorphism**: Allowing methods or operations to behave differently based on the object they are acting on.

//---

//3. **What is Encapsulation?**  
//   Encapsulation is the process of bundling data and methods into a single unit (class) and restricting direct access to some of the object's components to protect data integrity and enforce controlled access.

//---

//4. **What is a Sealed Class?**  
//   A sealed class is a class that cannot be inherited. It is used to prevent other classes from deriving from it and to enforce that the functionality of the class cannot be extended.

//---

//5. * *What is the Inheritance Concept?**
//   Inheritance is the OOP concept where one class (child/derived) inherits properties, methods, and behavior from another class (parent/base). It allows for code reuse and the creation of hierarchical relationships.
